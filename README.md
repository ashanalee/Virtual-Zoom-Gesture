# Virtual Zoom Gesture
This project demonstrates a virtual zoom feature using hand gestures detected via a webcam. By tracking the distance between two hands, it dynamically resizes and repositions an image on the screen. The project utilizes OpenCV for image processing and the cvzone library for hand detection.
## Features

- Real-time hand detection using OpenCV.
- Gesture recognition for zoom control.
- Dynamic image resizing based on hand movements.
- Interactive zoom functionality.
- Easy-to-understand code structure.
- Detailed documentation for setup and usage.
